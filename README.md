# julian-assange-tribute-page
Tribute page for FreeCodeCamp's first front end project.

This is my first "real" (maybe?) github repo, for my first front end project fulfilling FreeCodeCamp's Tribute Page challenge.
Just a small static page using HTML and CSS with Sass.

Live site can be seen at: https://julianassange-tributepage.surge.sh.
